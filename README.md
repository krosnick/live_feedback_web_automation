A prototype IDE for writing **web automation** scripts, to try to make it easier for developers to understand how their code will interact with a target website UI. The IDE integrates the target website UI into the editor and aligns it with code -- a snapshot of the target UI state is shown per line of code, CSS selectors and the elements they select are highlighted in the UI, and feedback on CSS selector uniqueness and validity are shown inline in the editor.
